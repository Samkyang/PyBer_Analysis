# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to make create an visualization from the analysis done on the ride data. The summary included a break down of the fares sorted by the type of area.

The visualization of the data was displayed in a line chart

## Results
The results from this analysis was pretty straight forward. The more rides a type area had the higher amount of total fares that type of area would receive.

## Summary
Some things that I would recommend to make this analysis better are:
  1. See how far each rider went or the duration of their trip. That way we can see the rate it each trip costs. We can then determine if drivers make more money in rural areas vs urban areas and offer incentives to drive in certain areas.
  2. Looking at the time of day is also another good factor to look at so that we can determine if what time of day riders are requesting rides so that drivers can know when to driver or if Pyber can raise the rates if there are not enough drivers.
  3. Having presentable dashboard for drivers of the data we presented would be nice so that drivers can estimate how much they will make at a given month, time of day, or type of area to drive in.
